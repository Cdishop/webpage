I recently created my first slide deck using [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie)'s awesome template called "Gentle Ggplot2." You can find the presentation [here](https://cdishop.github.io/methods_with_others/#1) and the [source code on my GitHub page](https://github.com/Cdishop/methods_with_others).
