title: "Translucent ggplot2 background for powerpoint"

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache = T}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F, cache = T)
```

The following parameters will render a translucent ggplot. When pasted into powerpoint, the background will not appear, leaving only the powerpoint template.

```{r, eval = F}

ggplot() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work with `theme_bw()` or `theme_classic()`.
